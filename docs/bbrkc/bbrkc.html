<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Gmacs is a generalized size-structured stock assessment modeling framework for molting crustacean species. Gmacs can make use of a wide variety of data, including fishery- and survey-based size-composition data, and fishery- dependent and -independent indices of abundance. Gmacs is coded using AD Model Builder <span class="citation">(Fournier et al. 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>Crab stocks of Alaska are managed by the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council (<a href="http://npfmc.org">NPFMC</a>). Some stocks are assessed with integrated size-structured assessment models of the form described in <span class="citation">Punt, Huang, and Maunder (2013)</span>. Currently, each stock is assessed using a stock-specific assessment model (e.g. <span class="citation">Zheng and Siddeek (2014)</span>). The Gmacs project aims to provide software that will allow each stock to be assessed independently but using a single flexible modeling framework.</p>
<p>This application is developed to compare with the current assessment model for the Bristol Bay Red King Crab (BBRKC) stock. The example assessment is intended to match closely with a model scenario presented to the Fall 2014 BSAI Crab Plan Team Meeting by <span class="citation">Zheng and Siddeek (2014)</span>. The following summarizes the outcome of some comparisons between the existing BBRKC stock assessment model <span class="citation">(Zheng and Siddeek 2014)</span> and an emulated version using the Gmacs platform.</p>
<p>An important component of the Gmacs framework is the provision of software for plotting Gmacs model outputs and incorporating model outputs directly into documentation. In what follows, we demonstrate the use of the <code>gmr</code> package to process the output of the Gmacs-BBRKC model and produce plots that can be used in assessment reports.</p>
<p>The Gmacs-BBRKC model presented here is intended to be an example comparison which may follow for application to other crab stocks. We provide some direct model comparisons to illustrate the efficacy of Gmacs and show how alternative models can be specified (but please see <a href="https://github.com/seacode/gmacs/wiki">Wiki</a> for up to date details of model specification and estimation).</p>
<h2 id="new-features">New features</h2>
<p>New features added to Gmacs since the CIE review include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved <strong>control over selectivity specification</strong> including: sex-specific parameter specification (allowing sex-specific retention as well); lower and upper bound specification for each selectivity parameter; priors for each selectivity parameter; provision for additional selectivity types (i.e. coefficient selectivity and double normal).</li>
<li>Improved <strong>control over fitting of size composition</strong> data including: the ability to aggregate size compositions (e.g. male and female size compositions from the same fishery) and fit them simultaneously within the multivariate distribution of choice; improvements to output files that are read into R for automated plotting of the observed and expected size compositions.</li>
<li><strong>Prior specification explicit</strong> now for all model parameters.</li>
<li>Option to provide a <strong>vector of weight at size</strong> rather than parameters.</li>
<li>Diagnostic &quot;gradient.dat&quot; at run completion has been added to help isolate parameters that are resulting in poor estimation properties.</li>
<li>A reference list <code>Gmacs.bib</code> containing references important to crab modeling and length-structured models in general.</li>
</ul>
<p>These new features have greatly improved the flexibility of the Gmacs modeling framework.</p>
<h2 id="in-development">In development</h2>
<p>Some other features requested by the NPFMC Crab Plan Team (CPT) and CIE reviews that are presently under development include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-normal and non-parametric selectivity types</li>
<li>Additional time-varying options for molt, growth and maturity</li>
<li>Dirichlet size composition option for likelihoods</li>
<li>Allowing additional variances to be estimated for abundance indices</li>
<li>Fully Bayesian MCMC functionality</li>
<li>A new series of MCMC diagnostic plots including plots of MCMC traces, histograms with priors overlayed, correlation plots, data and posterior predictive distributions</li>
<li>Adding diagnostics of likelihood fitting properties</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary-of-analytical-approach">Summary of analytical approach</h2>
<p>To reduce annual measurement errors associated with abundance estimates derived from the area-swept method, the ADFG developed a length-based analysis (LBA) in 1994 that incorporates multiple years of data and multiple data sources in the estimation procedure (Zheng et al. 1995a). Annual abundance estimates of the BBRKC stock from the LBA have been used to manage the directed crab fishery and to set crab bycatch limits in the groundfish fisheries since 1995. An alternative LBA (research model) was developed in 2004 to include small size groups for federal overfishing limits. The crab abundance declined sharply during the early 1980s. The LBA estimated natural mortality for different periods of years, whereas the research model estimated additional mortality beyond a basic constant natural mortality during 1976-1993.</p>
<p>The original LBA model was described in detail by Zheng et al. (1995a, 1995b) and Zheng and Kruse (2002). The model combines multiple sources of survey, catch, and bycatch data using a maximum likelihood approach to estimate abundance, recruitment, catchabilities, catches, and bycatch of the commercial pot fisheries and groundfish trawl fisheries.</p>
<p>Critical assumptions of the model include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The base natural mortality is constant over shell condition and size and was estimated assuming a maximum age of 25 and applying the 1% rule (Zheng 2005).</li>
<li>Survey and fisheries selectivities are a function of size and were constant over shell condition. Selectivities are a function of sex except for trawl bycatch selectivities, which are the same for both sexes. Two different survey selectivities were estimated: (1) 1975-1981 and (2) 1982-2013 based on modifications to the trawl gear used in the assessment survey. <em>Note: in the current assessment the survey selectivity asymptotes at 0.94 which may affect interpretation of the survey catchability</em></li>
<li>Growth is a function of size and is constant over time for males. For females, three growth increments per molt as a function of size were estimated based on sizes at maturity (1975-1982, 1983-1993, and 1994-2013). Once mature, female red king crabs grow with a much smaller growth increment per molt. <em>Note: this feature for dimorphic time-varying growth is currently unavailable in Gmacs</em></li>
<li>Molting probabilities are an inverse logistic function of size for males. Females molt annually.</li>
<li>Annual fishing seasons for the directed fishery are short. <em>Note: Gmacs uses the Baranov catch equation though options for developing pulse sequential forms are in development</em></li>
<li>Survey catchability (<span class="math"><em>q</em></span>) was estimated to be 0.896, based on a trawl experiment by Weinberg et al. (2004) with a standard deviation of 0.025. Survey catchability was assumed to be constant over time. Some scenarios estimate <span class="math"><em>q</em></span> in the model.</li>
<li>Males mature at sizes = 120 mm CL. For convenience, female abundance was summarized at sizes = 90 mm CL as an index of mature females. For summer trawl survey data, shell ages of newshell crabs were 12 months or less, and shell ages of oldshell and very oldshell crabs were more than 12 months.</li>
<li>Measurement errors were assumed to be normally distributed for size compositions and log-normally distributed for biomasses.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="gmacs-model-configurations">Gmacs model configurations</h1>
<p>The data and model specifications used in the Gmacs-BBRKC model were patterned after those in the '4nb' scenario developed by <span class="citation">Zheng and Siddeek (2014)</span>, herein referred to as the BBRKC model. The BBRKC model treats recruits independently by sex along with sex-specific natural mortality (<span class="math"><em>M</em></span>) and fishing mortality (<span class="math"><em>F</em></span>). Presently, the split-sex options in Gmacs only allows the assumption that the sex ratio at recruitment is 50:50. After recruiting, sexual dimorphic growth and mortality along with fishery effects can play a role in changes in sex ratio over time. In an attempt to provide a comparison with the male- component of the BBRKC model, we drafted one Gmacs configuration as a &quot;male- only&quot; or single sex model in addition to the split two-sex Gmacs configuration. Also for illustration purposes, the period and extent of data for the single-sex model was extended back to 1953. A full comparison of the approaches are shown in the following table:</p>

<p>The following plots summarize plots made using <code>gmr</code> based on output from <span class="citation">Zheng and Siddeek (2014)</span> and Gmacs. Two Gmacs models are presented, the OneSex model and the TwoSex model.</p>
<h2 id="fit-to-survey-abundance-indices">Fit to survey abundance indices</h2>
<p>In both the OneSex and TwoSex models priors were placed on <span class="math"><em>q</em></span> for the NMFS and BSFRF trawl surveys. A normal prior for the NMFS trawl survey was used with <span class="math"><em>μ</em> = 0. 843136</span> (i.e. <span class="math">0. 896 × 0. 941</span> which is the maximum selectivity of the NMFS survey in Jies model) and <span class="math"><em>σ</em> = 0. 01</span>. A normal prior is also used for the BSFRF trawl survey with <span class="math"><em>μ</em> = 1</span> and <span class="math"><em>σ</em> = 0. 03</span>.</p>
<p>The Gmacs model fits to survey biomass was somewhat better in the <span class="citation">Zheng and Siddeek (2014)</span> model (at least visually) than for either of the current implementations of Gmacs (Figure ).</p>

<h2 id="estimated-retained-catch-and-discards">Estimated retained catch and discards</h2>
<p>There are four fisheries defined in each of the models: the directed pot fishery, the groundfish trawl bycatch, the NMFS trawl surveys, and the BSFRF surveys. Each fishery has a mean fishing mortality with annual deviations. The observed and predicted catches by gear type are summarized in (Figure ). Data for discard fisheries were read in with 100% mortality (as clarified in Table 1 of <span class="citation">Zheng and Siddeek (2014)</span>).</p>

<h2 id="fit-to-size-composition-data">Fit to size composition data</h2>
<p>The fit of the Gmacs models to the BBRKC size composition data are shown in the following plots. These include fits to the directed pot fishery for males (Figure ), male crabs discarded in the directed pot fishery (Figure ), female crabs discarded in the directed pot fishery (Figure ), the groundfish trawl bycatch fisheries for males (Figure ) and females (Figure ), the NMFS trawl survey for newshell males (Figure ), oldshell males (Figure ) and females (Figure ), and the BSFRF survey (Figure ).</p>
<p>All size composition data were fitted using the robust multinomial distribution. In the OneSex model, new shell and old shell males were fitted simultaneously. In the TwoSex model the following size compositions were fitted simultaneously: discarded males and females; trawl bycatch males and females; NMFS trawl survey new shell males together with old shell males and females. The plots shown below have been normalized for display purposes. <em>In future plotting versions the scales will be retained as an option</em>.</p>

<h2 id="mean-weight-at-size">Mean weight-at-size</h2>
<p>The mean weight-at-size (<span class="math"><em>w</em><sub>ℓ</sub></span>) is defined in kg and the carapace length (<span class="math">ℓ</span>, CL) in mm. The mean weight-at-size used in all models is set to be identical to that of the BBRKC model (Figure ).</p>
<p>There are differences between immature and mature females hence the unusual shape of the length-weight relationship for females <span class="citation">(Zheng and Siddeek 2014)</span>. Given a size, once females mature with eggs, they are heavier than immature females. BBRKC uses immature mean weight-at-size for females &lt; 90 mm and mature mean weight- at- size for females &gt; 89 mm. The last four values of mean weight-at-size for females are effectively excluded (they exceed the last observed length group), so the plus group value is simply repeated. In future versions, when the immature and mature females are modeled separately, two mean weight- at-size functions can be used. The mean weights for both male and female plus length groups are higher than the function values to reflect that there are more crabs larger than the plus group mid sizes. This adjustment is based on the survey length frequency data over time.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="molting-increment-and-probability">Molting increment and probability</h2>
<p>In the BBRKC model one functional for for growth increment per molt is used for males and three functions for females (due to changing sizes at maturity).</p>
<p>Options to fit relationship based on data were developed within Gmacs but for the BBRKC system, a size-specific vector was used to determine molt increments as shown below (Figure ). Fixed parameters in gmacs were set to match assumptions in <span class="citation">Zheng and Siddeek (2014)</span> (Figure ).</p>

</div>
<p>In the BBRKC model, females are specified to molt annually consistent with their biology. This means that molting probability is always 1 for females and was replicated in the Gmacs model by fixing the logistic curves parameters to values that result in the molting probability being 1 for females across all modeled length classes. Male BBRKC molting patterns differ from females. As such, the BBRKC model was specified to have two molting probability curves, one during 1975-78 and another from 1979 to the present. <em>For the current version of Gmacs, only a single molting probability curve is allowed</em>.</p>

<p>The selectivity by size (<span class="math"><em>S</em><sub>ℓ</sub></span>) for each of the fisheries (Figure ). In the TwoSex model, selectivity in the directed pot fishery is sex-specific.

<p>The figure below illustrates implementation of four step changes in <span class="math"><em>M</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> (freely estimated) in gmacs relative to the estimates from Zheng et al. 2014 (Figure ). In both the ADFG-BBRKC and Gmacs-BBRKC models, time- varying natural mortality (<span class="math"><em>M</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span>) is freely estimated with four step changes through time. The years (<span class="math"><em>t</em></span>) that each of these steps cover are fixed a priori. The pattern in time-varying natural mortality is reasonably similar between the two models (Figure ), however the peak in natural mortality during the early 1980 is not as high in the Gmacs-BBRKC model. <em>In the Gmacs model, a spline function for natural mortality changes over time is an available as an option.</em></p>

<p>Comparisons of likelihood function components are available from the output but more detailed evaluation is needed. Simulation testing is also slated for evaluating alternative model specifications for robustness (e.g., constant natural mortality over time, time-varying selectivity, etc).</p>
<p>The current Gmacs models require that many of the key model parameters be fixed to obtain model fits that look similar to the BBRKC model.</p>
