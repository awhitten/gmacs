<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Gmacs is a generalized size-structured stock assessment modeling framework for molting crustacean species. Gmacs can make use of a wide variety of data, including fishery- and survey-based size-composition data, and fishery-dependent and -independent indices of abundance. Gmacs is coded using AD Model Builder.</p>
<p>Crab stocks of Alaska are managed by the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council (<a href="http://npfmc.org">NPFMC</a>). Some stocks are assessed with integrated size-structured assessment models of the form described in <span class="citation">Punt, Huang, and Maunder (2013)</span>. Currently, each stock is assessed using a stock-specific assessment model (e.g. <span class="citation">Zheng and Siddeek (2014)</span>). The Gmacs project aims to provide software that will allow each stock to be assessed independently but using a single modeling framework.</p>
<p>Gmacs is used here to develop an assessment model for the Bristol Bay Red King Crab (BBRKC) stock. The example assessment is intended to match closely with a model scenario presented to the Fall 2014 BSAI Crab Plan Team Meeting by <span class="citation">Zheng and Siddeek (2014)</span>. The following summarizes the outcome of some comparisons between the existing BBRKC stock assessment model <span class="citation">(Zheng and Siddeek 2014)</span> and an emulated version using the Gmacs platform.</p>
<p>An important component of the Gmacs framework is the provision of software for plotting Gmacs model outputs. In what follows, we demonstrate the use of the <code>gmr</code> package to process the output of the Gmacs-BBRKC model and produce plots that can be used in assessment reports.</p>
<p>Together, the Gmacs-BBRKC model and this report serve as the first example of what should follow for other crab stocks: that is, direct model comparisons to (1) test the efficacy of Gmacs, and (2) determine whether Gmacs can be used in practice to closely match the outputs of existing ADFG stock assessment models.</p>
<h2 id="new-features">New features</h2>
<p>New features added to Gmacs since the CIE review include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved control over selectivity specification including: sex-specific parameter specification (allowing sex-specific retention); lower and upper bound specification for each selectivity parameter; priors for each selectivity parameter; provision for additional selectivity types (i.e. coefficient selectivity and double normal).</li>
<li>Improved control over fitting of size composition data including: the ability to aggregate size compositions (e.g. male and female size compositions from the same fishery) and fit them simultaneously within the multivariate distribution of choice; output files that are read into R for automated plotting of the observed and expected size compositions.</li>
<li>Prior specification for all model parameters.</li>
<li>Ability to provide a vector of weight at size rather than parameters</li>

<h2 id="summary-of-analytical-approach">Summary of analytical approach</h2>
<p>To reduce annual measurement errors associated with abundance estimates derived from the area-swept method, the ADFG developed a length-based analysis (LBA) in 1994 that incorporates multiple years of data and multiple data sources in the estimation procedure (Zheng et al. 1995a). Annual abundance estimates of the BBRKC stock from the LBA have been used to manage the directed crab fishery and to set crab bycatch limits in the groundfish fisheries since 1995. An alternative LBA (research model) was developed in 2004 to include small size groups for federal overfishing limits. The crab abundance declined sharply during the early 1980s. The LBA estimated natural mortality for different periods of years, whereas the research model estimated additional mortality beyond a basic constant natural mortality during 1976-1993.</p>
<p>The original LBA model was described in detail by Zheng et al. (1995a, 1995b) and Zheng and Kruse (2002). The model combines multiple sources of survey, catch, and bycatch data using a maximum likelihood approach to estimate abundance, recruitment, catchabilities, catches, and bycatch of the commercial pot fisheries and groundfish trawl fisheries.</p>
<p>Critical assumptions of the model include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The base natural mortality is constant over shell condition and size and was estimated assuming a maximum age of 25 and applying the 1% rule (Zheng 2005).</li>
<li>Survey and fisheries selectivities are a function of size and were constant over shell condition. Selectivities are a function of sex except for trawl bycatch selectivities, which are the same for both sexes. Two different survey selectivities were estimated: (1) 1975-1981 and (2) 1982-2013 based on modifications to the trawl gear used in the assessment survey.</li>
<li>Growth is a function of size and did not change over time for males. For females, three growth increments per molt as a function of size were estimated based on sizes at maturity (1975-1982, 1983-1993, and 1994-2013). Once mature, female red king crabs grow with a much smaller growth increment per molt.</li>
<li>Molting probabilities are an inverse logistic function of size for males. Females molt annually.</li>
<li>Annual fishing seasons for the directed fishery are short.</li>
<li>Survey catchability (<span class="math"><em>q</em></span>) was estimated to be 0.896, based on a trawl experiment by Weinberg et al. (2004) with a standard deviation of 0.025. Survey catchability was assumed to be constant over time. Some scenarios estimate <span class="math"><em>q</em></span> in the model.</li>
<li>Males mature at sizes =120 mm CL. For convenience, female abundance was summarized at sizes =90 mm CL as an index of mature females. viii. For summer trawl survey data, shell ages of newshell crabs were 12 months or less, and shell ages of oldshell and very oldshell crabs were more than 12 months.</li>
<li>Measurement errors were assumed to be normally distributed for size compositions and were log- normally distributed for biomasses.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="gmacs">Gmacs</h1>
<p>The data and model specifications used in the Gmacs-BBRKC model are very similar to those used in the '4nb' scenario developed by <span class="citation">Zheng and Siddeek (2014)</span>, herein referred to as the BBRKC model. The BBRKC model from <span class="citation">Zheng and Siddeek (2014)</span> treats recruits by sex along with sex-specific natural mortality and fishing mortality. Here we provide results from two different Gmacs models (1) a two-sex model and (2) a single sex model in which the male components are compared with results from a Gmacs model implementation tuned to male-only data.</p>
<p>Parameter Number of estimated parameters Value Natural mortality 1 Males (1980-84) 1 Females (1980-84) 1 Females (1976-79; 1984-1993) 0.18 yr-1 Other years</p>
<p>In the BBRKC model, females molt annually, so molting probability is always 1 for females. This was replicated in the Gmacs model by fixing the logistic curves parameters to values that result in the molting probability being 1 for females across all modeled length classes. For the males, the BBRKC model has two molting probability curves, one during 1975-78 and another during 1979-present, each with two logistic curve parameters. In the current version of Gmacs, only a single molting probability curve is modeled.</p>
<p>The growth increment per molt is one function for males and three functions for females (due to changing sizes at maturity).</p>
<p>Each fishery has a mean fishing mortality with annual deviations. Describe selectivity.</p>
<p>Total abundance and the proportions by length and sex are estimated in 1975 (the models initial year).</p>
<p>Comparison tables of two different model approaches could be done by</p>
<p>Pot fishery, trawl bycatch, NMFS trawl, BSFRF</p>

<h2 id="mean-weight-at-size">Mean weight-at-size</h2>
<p>The mean weight-at-size (<span class="math"><em>w</em><sub>ℓ</sub></span>) is defined in kg and the carapace length (<span class="math">ℓ</span>, CL) in mm. The mean weight-at-size used in all models is identical because the new option to provide a vector of weights at length is used (Figure ).</p>
<p>There are differences between immature and mature females hence the unusual shape of the length-weight relationship for females. Given a size, once females mature with eggs, they are heavier than immature females. ADFG uses immature mean weight-at-size for females &lt; 90 mm and mature mean weight- at- size for females &gt; 89 mm. The last four values of mean weight-at-size for females are not used (exceeding the last length group), so the plus group value is simply repeated. In the future, when the immature and mature females are modeled separately, two mean weight- at-size functions should be used. The mean weights for both male and female plus length groups are higher than the function values to reflect that there are more crabs larger than the plus group mid sizes. The adjustment is based on the survey length frequency data over time.</p>

The years (<span class="math"><em>t</em></span>) that each of these steps cover are fixed a priori. The pattern in time-varying natural mortality is reasonably similar between the two models (Figure ), however the peak in natural mortality during the early 1980 is not as high in the Gmacs-BBRKC model.</p>

<p>We need to be able to produce a table of the comparative likelihoods (by component) of the alternative models. For best practice, just try and do what we do with SS models for SESSF stocks anyway. See the pink link report, and enter a section for each of those, and see if we can emulate a report of that type.</p>
<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>Comparisons of actual likelihood function values and year-specific fits using the robust-multinomial would be the next step after selectivity issues are resolved. Subsequent to that, it would be worth exploring aspects of alternative model specifications (e.g., constant natural mortality over time, time-varying selectivity, etc) to evaluate sensitivities.</p>
<p>This discussion will focus on the challenges in developing a Gmacs version of the BBRKC model: those met, and those yet to be met.</p>
