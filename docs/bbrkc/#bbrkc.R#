# Introduction

Gmacs is a generalized size-structured stock assessment modeling framework for
molting crustacean species. Gmacs can make use of a wide variety of data,
including fishery- and survey-based size-composition data, and fishery-
dependent and -independent indices of abundance. Gmacs is coded using AD Model
Builder [@Fournier2012b].

Crab stocks of Alaska are managed by the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council ([NPFMC](http://npfmc.org)). Some stocks are assessed with integrated
size-structured assessment models of the form described in @punt_review_2013.
Currently, each stock is assessed using a stock-specific assessment model
(e.g. @zheng_bristol_2014). The Gmacs project aims to provide software that
will allow each stock to be assessed independently but using a single flexible
modeling framework.

This document presents the development and application of two Gmacs models and
compares these to the current assessment model for the Bristol Bay Red King
Crab (BBRKC) stock. The example assessments are intended to match closely with
a model scenario presented to the Fall 2014 BSAI Crab Plan Team Meeting by
@zheng_bristol_2014.

An important component of the Gmacs framework is the provision of software for
understanding the outputs produced by the Gmacs model. This includes plotting
Gmacs model outputs and incorporating model outputs directly into
documentation. In what follows, we demonstrate the use of the `gmr` package to
process the output of the Gmacs-BBRKC model and produce plots that can be used
in assessment reports. This document serves as an example of how Gmacs outputs
can be directly incorporated into text in an automated way (for example, this
document is compiled by simply typing "make" at the command line in the
"gmacs/docs/bbrkc" directory).

The Gmacs-BBRKC model presented here is intended to provide an example of what
may follow for application to other crab stocks. We provide some direct model
comparisons to  illustrate the efficacy of Gmacs and show how alternative
models can be specified (but please see
[Wiki](https://github.com/seacode/gmacs/wiki) for up to date details of model
specification and estimation).


## New features

New features added to Gmacs since the Center for Independent Experts (CIE)
review include:

  * Improved **control over selectivity specification** including: sex-specific parameter
    specification (allowing sex-specific retention as well); lower and upper bound specification for 
    each selectivity parameter; priors for each selectivity parameter; provision for additional 
    selectivity types (i.e. coefficient selectivity and double normal).
  * Improved **control over fitting of size composition** data including: the ability to aggregate size 
    compositions (e.g. male and female size compositions from the same fishery) and fit them 
    simultaneously within the multivariate distribution of choice; improvements to output files that are read into R for 
    automated plotting of the observed and expected size compositions.
  * Explicit **Prior specification** now provided for all model parameters.
  * Option to provide a **vector of weight at size** rather than parameters.
  * Diagnostic "gradient.dat" at run completion has been added to help isolate parameters that are resulting in poor estimation properties.
  * A reference list `Gmacs.bib` containing references important to crab modeling and length-structured models in general.

These new features have greatly improved the flexibility of the Gmacs modeling framework.


## In development

Some other features requested by the NPFMC Crab Plan Team (CPT) and CIE
reviewers that are presently under development include:

  * Double-normal and non-parametric selectivity types
  * Additional time-varying options for molt, growth and maturity
  * Dirichlet size composition option for likelihoods
  * Allowing additional variances to be estimated for abundance indices
  * Fully Bayesian MCMC functionality
  * A new series of MCMC diagnostic plots including plots of MCMC traces, histograms with priors 
    overlayed, correlation plots, data and posterior predictive distributions
  * Adding diagnostics of likelihood fitting properties
  * Specifying $q$ as a model parameter rather than a derived variable


## Summary of analytical approach

To reduce annual measurement errors associated with abundance estimates
derived from the area-swept method, the ADFG developed a length-based analysis
(LBA) in 1994 that incorporates multiple years of data and multiple data
sources in the estimation procedure (Zheng et al. 1995a). Annual abundance
estimates of the BBRKC stock from the LBA have been used to manage the
directed crab fishery and to set crab bycatch limits in the groundfish
fisheries since 1995. An alternative LBA (research model) was developed in
2004 to include small size groups for federal overfishing limits. The crab
abundance declined sharply during the early 1980s. The LBA estimated natural
mortality for different periods of years, whereas the research model estimated
additional mortality beyond a basic constant natural mortality during
1976-1993.

The original LBA model was described in detail by Zheng et al. (1995a, 1995b)
and Zheng and Kruse (2002). The model combines multiple sources of survey,
catch, and bycatch data using a maximum likelihood approach to estimate
abundance, recruitment, catchabilities, catches, and bycatch of the commercial
pot fisheries and groundfish trawl fisheries.

Critical assumptions of the model include:

  * The base natural mortality is constant over shell condition and size and was
    estimated assuming a maximum age of 25 and applying the 1% rule (Zheng
    2005).
  * Survey and fisheries selectivities are a function of size and were constant
    over shell condition.  Selectivities are a function of sex except for trawl
    bycatch selectivities, which are the same for both sexes. Two different
    survey selectivities were estimated: (1) 1975-1981 and (2) 1982-2013 based
    on modifications to the trawl gear used in the assessment survey. _Note: in 
    the current assessment the survey selectivity asymptotes at 0.94 which may affect
    interpretation of the survey catchability_
  * Growth is a function of size and is constant over time for males. For
    females, three growth increments per molt as a function of size were
    estimated based on sizes at maturity (1975-1982, 1983-1993, and
    1994-2013). Once mature, female red king crabs grow with a much smaller
    growth increment per molt. _Note: this feature for dimorphic time-varying growth
    is currently unavailable in Gmacs_
  * Molting probabilities are an inverse logistic function of size for
    males. Females molt annually.
  * Annual fishing seasons for the directed fishery are short. _Note: Gmacs uses
    the Baranov catch equation though options for developing pulse sequential forms are 
    in development_
  * Survey catchability ($q$) was estimated to be 0.896, based on a trawl
    experiment by Weinberg et al. (2004) with a standard deviation
    of 0.025. Survey catchability was assumed to be constant over time. Some
    scenarios estimate $q$ in the model.
  * Males mature at sizes = 120 mm CL. For convenience, female abundance was
    summarized at sizes = 90 mm CL as an index of mature females. For
    summer trawl survey data, shell ages of newshell crabs were 12 months or
    less, and shell ages of oldshell and very oldshell crabs were more than 12
    months.
  * Measurement errors were assumed to be normally distributed for size
    compositions and log-normally distributed for biomasses.


# Gmacs model configurations

The data and model specifications used in the Gmacs-BBRKC model were patterned
after those in the '4nb' scenario developed by @zheng_bristol_2014, herein
referred to as the BBRKC model. The BBRKC model treats recruits independently
by sex along with sex-specific natural mortality ($M$) and fishing mortality
($F$). Presently, the split-sex options in Gmacs only allows the assumption
that the sex ratio at recruitment is 50:50. After recruiting, sexually
dimorphic growth and mortality along with fishery effects can play a role in
changes in sex ratio over time.  In an attempt to provide a comparison with
the male- component of the BBRKC model,  we drafted one Gmacs configuration as
a "male- only" or single sex model (OneSex) in addition to the split two-sex
Gmacs configuration (TwoSex). A full comparison of the approaches are shown in
the following table:

Specification        | Parameter | ADFG Value | Gmacs OneSex | Gmacs TwoSex
-------------------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------------
Start year           | $t=0$     | 1975       | 1975         | 1975

# Comparison of model results

The following plots summarize plots made using `gmr` based on output from
@zheng_bristol_2014 and Gmacs. Two Gmacs models are presented, the OneSex
model and the TwoSex model.


## Fit to survey abundance indices

In both the OneSex and TwoSex models priors were placed on the catchability
coefficient ($q$) for the NMFS and BSFRF trawl surveys. A normal prior for the
NMFS trawl survey was used with $\mu = 0.843136$ (i.e. $0.896 \times 0.941$
which is the maximum selectivity of the NMFS survey in Jies model) and $\sigma
= 0.01$. A normal prior is also used for the BSFRF trawl survey with  $\mu =
1$ and $\sigma = 0.03$.

The Gmacs model fits to survey biomass was somewhat better in the
@zheng_bristol_2014 model (at least visually) than for either of the current
implementations of Gmacs (Figure \ref{fig:survey_biomass}). We feel that the
way that $q$ is currently specified in the model (i.e. $q$ is integrated out)
is inadequate as it allows the model to explore unrealistic parameter space.
We intend to provide an option to specify $q$ as a parameter of the model.

    n <- length(M)
    mdf <- NULL
    for (i in 1:n) {
        A <- M[[i]]
        df <- data.frame(Model = names(M)[i], as.data.frame(A$dSurveyData))
        colnames(df) <- c("Model", "year", "seas", "fleet", "sex",

        df$pred <- na.exclude(as.vector(t(A$pre_cpue)))
        df$resd <- na.exclude(as.vector(t(A$res_cpue)))
        mdf <- rbind(mdf, df)
    }

```{r survey_biomass, fig.cap = "Model fits to sex-specific NMFS trawl survey biomass (tons) from 1975 to 2014. The error bars represent plus and minus 2 standard deviations.\\label{fig:survey_biomass}"}
plot_cpue(M, "NMFS Trawl", ylab = "Survey biomass (tons)")
#plot_cpue(M, ylab = "Survey biomass (tons)")
```


## Estimated retained catch and discards 

There are four fisheries defined in each of the models: the directed pot
fishery, the groundfish trawl bycatch, the NMFS trawl surveys, and the BSFRF
surveys. Each fishery has a mean fishing mortality with annual deviations. The
mean fishing mortality in the directed pot fishery and the trawl bycatch
fishery is 0.2 and 0.05, respectively. The mean fishing mortality in the two
surveys is zero.

The observed and predicted catches by gear type in each of the Gmacs models
are summarized (Figure \ref{fig:fit_to_catch}). Data for discard fisheries
were read in with 100% mortality (as clarified in Table 1 of
@zheng_bristol_2014).

```{r fit_to_catch, fig.cap = "Observed and predicted catch (tons) by gear type for the two Gmacs models. The OneSex model includes catch data from 1953 to 2013. The TwoSex model includes catch data from 1975 to 2013.\\label{fig:fit_to_catch}"}
# Create a list that only contains the OneSex and TwoSex models
A <- M; A[[3]] <- NULL
plot_catch(A)
```

## Fit to size composition data

The fit of the Gmacs models to the BBRKC size composition data are shown in
the following plots. These include fits to the directed pot fishery for males
(Figure \ref{fig:sc_pot_m}), male crabs discarded in the directed pot fishery
(Figure \ref{fig:sc_pot_discarded_m}), female crabs discarded in the directed
pot fishery (Figure \ref{fig:sc_pot_discarded_f}), the groundfish trawl
bycatch fisheries for males (Figure \ref{fig:sc_trawl_bycatch_m}) and females
(Figure \ref{fig:sc_trawl_bycatch_f}), the NMFS trawl survey for newshell
males (Figure \ref{fig:sc_NMFS_nm}), oldshell males (Figure
\ref{fig:sc_NMFS_om}) and females (Figure \ref{fig:sc_NMFS_f}), and the BSFRF
survey (Figure \ref{fig:sc_BSFRF}).

All size composition data were fitted using the robust multinomial
distribution. In the OneSex model, new shell and old shell males were fitted
simultaneously. In the TwoSex model the following size compositions were
fitted simultaneously: discarded males and females; trawl bycatch males and
females; NMFS trawl survey new shell males together with old shell males and
females. The plots shown below have been normalized for display purposes. _In
future plotting versions the scales will be retained as an option_.

## Mean weight-at-size

The mean weight-at-size ($w_\ell$) is defined in kg and the carapace length
($\ell$, CL) in mm. The mean weight-at-size used in all models is set to be
identical to that of the BBRKC model (Figure \ref{fig:length-weight}).

There are differences between immature and mature females hence the unusual
shape of the length-weight relationship for females [@zheng_bristol_2014].
Given a size, once females mature with eggs, they are heavier than immature
females. BBRKC uses immature mean weight-at-size for females < 90 mm and mature
mean weight- at- size for females > 89 mm. The last four values of mean
weight-at-size for females are effectively excluded (they exceed the last
observed length group), so the plus group value is simply repeated.  In
future versions, when the immature and mature females are modeled separately,
two mean weight- at-size functions can be used. The mean weights for both male
and female plus length groups are higher than the function values to reflect
that there are more crabs larger than the plus group mid sizes. This
adjustment is based on the survey length frequency data over time.

```{r length_weight, fig.cap = "Relationship between carapace width (mm) and weight (kg) by sex in each of the models (provided as a vector of weights at length to Gmacs so lines all overlap).\\label{fig:length-weight}"}

plot_length_weight(M, xlab = "Carapace width (mm)", ylab = "Weight (kg)")
.OVERLAY <- TRUE
```


## Initial recruitment size distribution

Gmacs was configured to match the @zheng_bristol_2014 model recruitment size
distribution closely (Figure \ref{fig:init_rec}).

```{r init_rec, fig.cap = "Distribution of carapace width (mm) at recruitment.\\label{fig:init_rec}"}
plot_recruitment_size(M, xlab = "Carapace width (mm)")
```


## Molting increment and probability

In the BBRKC model one function for for growth increment per molt is used
for males and three functions for females (due to changing sizes at maturity).

Options to fit relationship based on data were developed within Gmacs but for
the BBRKC system, a size-specific vector was used to determine molt increments
as shown below (Figure \ref{fig:growth_inc}). Fixed parameters in gmacs were
set to match assumptions in @zheng_bristol_2014 (Figure \ref{fig:molt_prob}).

```{r growth_inc, fig.cap = "Growth increment (mm) each molt by sex in the OneSex and TwoSex models.\\label{fig:growth_inc}"}
plot_growth_inc(A)
#plot_growth_inc(M)
```

In the BBRKC model, females are specified to molt annually consistent with
their biology. This means that molting probability is always 1 for females.
This was replicated in the Gmacs model by fixing the logistic curve
parameters to values that result in the molting probability being 1 for
females across all modeled length classes. Male BBRKC molting patterns differ
from females. As such, the BBRKC  model was specified to have two molting
probability curves, one during 1975-78 and another from 1979 to the present.
_For the current version of Gmacs, only a single molting probability curve is
allowed_.

```{r molt_prob, fig.cap = "Molting probability for each of the models by sex. The molting probability for females is fixed at 1 as females molt every year.\\label{fig:molt_prob}"}
plot_molt_prob(M, xlab = "Carapace length (mm)")
```


## Transition processes

The first set of figures include the growth probabilities (for all crabs that molt)
(Figure \ref{fig:growth_trans}). The second set of figures is the combination
of growth and molting probabilities and represents the size transition (Figure
\ref{fig:size_trans}).

```{r growth_trans, fig.cap = "Growth transitions.\\label{fig:growth_trans}"}
plot_growth_transition(M, xlab = "Carapace length (mm)")
```

```{r size_trans, fig.cap = "Size transitions.\\label{fig:size_trans}"}
plot_size_transition(M, xlab = "Carapace length (mm)", female = TRUE)
```


## Numbers at length in the first and last year

Total abundance and the proportions by length and sex are estimated in 1975
(the models initial year).

The number of crabs in each size class (${\bf n}$) in the initial year ($t=1$)
and final year ($t=T$) in each model differ substantially (Figure
\ref{fig:init_N}). The scale of these results differ significantly and may be
related to the interaction with natural mortality estimates and how the initial
population-at-lengths were established (the BBRKC model assumes all new-shell).

```{r init_N, fig.cap = "Numbers at length in 1953, 1975 and 2014 in each of the models. The first year of the OneSex model is 1953. The first year of the Zheng and TwoSex models in 1975.\\label{fig:init_N}"}
plot_numbers(M, c("1953","1975","2014"))
```


## Selectivity

The selectivity by size ($S_\ell$) for each of the fisheries are presented
below (Figure \ref{fig:selectivity}). In the all models, selectivity in the
trawl bycatch fishery is constant by sex. In all other fisheries, selectivity
is sex-specific. In the NMFS trawl fishery, a different selectivity curve is
estimated for the 1975-1981 period and for the 1982-2014 period.

```{r selectivity, fig.cap = "Estimated selectivity at size, sex and fishery in the OneSex, TwoSex and Zheng models. Estimated selectivities are shown for the directed pot fishery, the trawl bycatch fishery, the NMFS trawl survey, and the BSFRF survey.\\label{fig:selectivity}"}
plot_selectivity(M, ncol = 4)
```


## Natural mortality

In both the BBRKC and Gmacs models, time-varying natural mortality ($M_t$) is
freely estimated with four step changes through time. The years ($t$) that
each of these steps cover are fixed a priori at 1976, 1980, 1985 and 1994. The
pattern in time-varying natural mortality is reasonably similar between the
three models (Figure \ref{fig:M_t}), however the peak in natural mortality
during the early 1980 is not as high in the Gmacs models. _In the Gmacs model,
a spline function for natural mortality changes over time is also available as
an option._

```{r natural_mortality, fig.cap = "Time-varying natural mortality ($M_t$). Periods begin at 1976, 1980, 1985 and 1994.\\label{fig:M_t}"}
plot_natural_mortality(M)
```


## Recruitment

Recruitment ($R_t$) patterns are similar among models, but differences in
natural mortality schedules will affect these matches. It is also important to
keep in mind that recruitment in the OneSex model only represents recruitment
of males, while in the TwoSex and BBRKC models recruitment is for females and
males combined. The figure below shows that the values have roughly the same
mean (Figure \ref{fig:recruitment}).

```{r recruitment, fig.cap = "Estimated recruitment time series ($R_t$) in the OneSex, TwoSex and BBRKC models. Note that recruitment in the OneSex model represents recruitment of males only.\\label{fig:recruitment}"}
plot_recruitment(M)
```


## Mature male biomass (MMB)

The spawning stock biomass (tons) of mature males, termed the mature male
biomass ($\mathit{MMB}_t$), varies somewhat between each of the models (Figure
\ref{fig:ssb}).

```{r spawning_stock_biomass, fig.cap = "Mature male biomass (MMB) predicted in the two versions of the Gmacs model (OneSex and TwoSex) and the Zheng model.\\label{fig:ssb}"}
A <- M; A[[1]] <- NULL
mval <- 3.2e5
#plot_ssb(M, ylim = c(0, mval))
plot_ssb(M)

## Comparison of model results
#The results of the ADFG-BBRKC model are compared here to the results of the
#Gmacs-BBRKC model.
#Model           | FSPR | BSPR     | FOFL | OFL     | RSPR
#--------------- | ----:| --------:| ----:| -------:| --------:
#Gmacs (one sex) | 0.28 | 32995.95 | 0.28 | 3373.93 | 8160.40
#Gmacs (two sex) | 0.21 | 22205.54 | 0.21 | 3030.39 | 16959.09
### Gmacs results
#We need to be able to produce a table of the comparative likelihoods (by
# component) of the alternative models. For best practice, just try and do what we
# do with SS models for SESSF stocks anyway. See the pink link report, and enter a
# section for each of those, and see if we can emulate a report of that type.

```


# Discussion
Comparisons of likelihood function components are available from the output
but more  detailed evaluation is needed. Simulation testing is also slated for
evaluating alternative model specifications for robustness (e.g. constant
natural mortality over time, time-varying selectivity, etc).

The current Gmacs models require that many of the key model parameters be fixed to
obtain model fits that look similar to the BBRKC model.

Differences between Gmacs and the BBRKC model produced by
@zheng_bristol_2014 are likely due to the use of the Baranov catch equation
in Gmacs and the way that the initial numbers at length are derived (both new and old-shell are estimated in Gmacs).
As part of the model development schedule, alternative catch equations and intialization options in Gmacs will be added
so that a broader range of assumptions can be made (and perhaps become more similar to that used by @zheng_bristol_2014).
