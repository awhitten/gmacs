        \begin{block}{\large General Size-structured Equilibrium Model}


          Given a vector $\bm{n} = (n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_m)$ that represents the number of individuals in discrete
          size bins in a given year.  Each year the numbers in each size bin are subject to 
          growth and survival $\bm{A}$ and the addition of recruits $\bm{r}$.
          Assuming growth and survival is a linear function of the number of 
          individuals in each size bin, then the following matrix equation represents
          the steady-state or equilibrium conditions:
          \[\bm{n} = \bm{A}\bm{n} + \bm{r}\]
          with the equilibrium solution for the numbers-at-size given by
          \[\bm{n} = -(\bm{A} - \bm{I})^{-1} (\bm{r})\]
          where $\bm{I}$ is the $m$ x $m$ identity matrix. In practical terms, the 
          challenge is in developing the matrix $\bm{A}$ and the vector of new recruitment
          $\bm{r}$.\\[1ex]

          GMACS is based on this simple matrix equation equation for modeling the dynamics of molting probabilities, size-transition or growth, and also jointly models various life-history stages, such as, new- and old-shell crab.

          % Our approach accommodates the dynamics of molting probabilities, and 
          % jointly modeling the abundance of new and old shell crabs and maturity state.

          \justifying 
          Stock reduction analysis (SRA) is a data-poor technique that typically just uses historical 
          catch information to estimate recruitment rates needed to explain those historical catches.  
          The method is easily extended to accommodate sparse information on trends in abundance, 
          composition information, and tagging data.  Estimation of model parameters using maximum 
          likelihood or Bayesian methods is possible.  GMACS is a generalized framework for size-structured 
          models suitable for data-poor to data-rich assessments.  Reference points are derived from 
          steady-state conditions by solving matrix equations that represent size-dependent mortality 
          and growth.   Our results show how the scalability of GMACS can be used as an integrated
          data-poor assessment method. Next steps include the evaluation of such ``simple'' methods testing 
          simulated data generated from within GMACS (or from a separate R package) but configured to have 
          greater complexity of underlying dynamics (e.g., time-varying natural mortality)

        \begin{block}{\large Reference Points (SPR-based)}
          The Spawning Potential Ratio (SPR) is the ratio of spawning stock biomass in 
          fished:unfished conditions.  Or,
          \[SPR = \dfrac{\tilde{\phi}_B}{\phi_B}\] 
          Fishing mortality that achieves SPR values in the range of 0.3-0.4 are 
          often considered a proxy for rates associated with Maximum Sustainable Yield.
          GMACS uses an interative solution based on solving equations \eqref{T1.14} 
          and \eqref{T1.16} to find the fishing mortality rate 
          ($F_{\mbox{SPR}}$) that corresponds to a specified SPR value.

          % Catch in the BBRKC fishery peaked in 1980 at nearly 59,000 mt (Fig.~\ref{figCatch}), followed by a 50\%
          % decrease in the fishery CPUE (Fig.~\ref{figCPUE_MMB}).  Prior to the 1980s landings averaged 18,470 mt and
          % post 1984 landings averaged 5,060 mt.  Trends in the NMFS trawl survey did not increase
          % in responsed to reduced harvest.  Size composition Fig.~\ref{figSizeComps}

            \item The joint probability model \eqref{T4.5} attempts to simultaneously estimate
            retained and discarded catch (Fig. \ref{figCatch}).
            \item Catch only method requires prior information on one of the following:
              \begin{itemize}
                 \item Average fishing mortality rates, or
                 \item an estimate of current depletion level, or
                 \item an estimate of absolute fishing mortality for one or more gears.
               \end{itemize} 
            \item Estimates of \fspr\ are consistent across models because same natural
            mortality and selectivity are assumed (Table \ref{tab:spr_results}).

        \begin{block}{\large Discussion}
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Size- or stage-structured models contain additional confounding between estimates of recruitment, size-transition, and size-based mortality in contrast to age-structured models.
            \item It is possible to conduct Stock Reduction Analysis (using only catch data) and additional assumptions about natural mortality, growth, and the size-distribution of new recruits.
            \item The generalized size-structured equilibrium model also extends to additional classes such as sex, new and old-shell, immature and mature animals.
