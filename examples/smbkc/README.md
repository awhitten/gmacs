# Setup for Saint Matthews Blue King Crab model
  run.sh for linux machines 
  run.bat for windows
## Notes on model
	First selectivity parameters have an issue (huge gradients)            
	LogR0 probably shouldn't be turned on since model not initialized at unfished            
  size at recruitment can't really be estimated with this number of bins?
